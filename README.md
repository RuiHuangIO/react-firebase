# Fiyabse-CRUD

This is a simple "blog-like" CRUD application I built in React & Redux with Firbase as the back end. It has a few Firebase cloud functions to push notifications to the dashboard when a new post / new user is added.

Overall, this is a great project for me in terms of learning React by building an actual project. Master branch is the initial version of this project.

I have a few ideas on how this project can be done better and will probably play around with those in other branches.

## Future plans for this project:

- Implement update & delete functions
- Add routing to notifications
- Testing
- Try Unstated or RXJS
- Material UI instead of MaterializeCSS?
- Implement better security practices before deployment
- Try ReactHooks whenever that comes out
